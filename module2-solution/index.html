		<div><p>All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act on their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible.
		T.E. Lawrence</p></div>
		<div><p>The boy who is going to make a great man must not make up his mind merely to overcome a thousand obstacles, but to win in spite of a thousand repulses and defeats.
		Theodore Roosevelt</p></div>
		<div><p>When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive - to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love.
		Marcus Aurelius</p></div>
